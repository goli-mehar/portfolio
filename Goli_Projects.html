                    <p>Toilet leaks can often be costly financially and environmentally due to the water wastage they incur, and while solvable there is yet to exist an efficient method to quickly notify an owner of any leaks. In the current system, leaks
                        often persist for months - often becoming apparent due to irregular increases in the water bill. Thus, the objective of this project was to build a device such that it will quickly notify an owner of a toilet leak. A window sensor
                        and an arduino based interface were utilized to create the device, with a computer program to run the device and then utilize IFTTT to notify the homeowner of the leak. This project thus served as my first real experience in programming,
                        having to work diligently to perfect my code. I had to apply my knowledge of CS, gained through Java, while also learning and understanding how Arduino and the ESP8266 board work. During experimentation, water sensors were found
                        to be more efficient and were thus incorporated, in addition, a speaker was added to notify the owner audibly. For further research, the device may be modified to work with pipes as well as be extended to work with multiple toilets
                        or even be connected to the home security system.</p>

                    <p> For students entering the medical field, it is crucial to understand the process of grand rounds and how they are used to measure a medical student's readiness for the field. Thus, the objective of this project was to build an imaginary
                        patient case file, from start to scratch, and to maybe be selected for the finals. As for any patient, multiple doctors are involved. Here, I served as the Gastroenterologist, writing up order forms the required tests for the patient
                        as well as simulating the results the patient would have had over the course of the experiment. During this project we each were kept on our toes to finish our parts while also notifying the others - learning along the way that
                        we needed to communicate in order to succeed with this project. This project ended with my group becoming finalists for the competition aspect, the Grand Rounds. </p>

                    <p> The objective of this project was to create an interactive storyline in which the player is able to build their own story. This was achieved through the use of Scratch and its ability to showcase different scenes, allowing for the
                        development of a storyline. Within this project, I served as the main programmer - learning and understanding how to use Scratch in order to build the game effectively. This role came as a result of group struggles in sharing work,
                        each of us had our own strengths and thus decided to take on different roles. Hence I handled programming while my partner dealt with documentation</p>

                    <p>Colored Dots, a baseline MIT App Inventor Application, consists of drawing with colored dots. While intereactive, the application is - overall - bland in taste. As such, the objective of this project was to revamp the application and
                        to make it more desirable to the average consumer. This project thus required becoming familiar with MIT App Inventor, and detailed accounts and block diagrams for the new app design. Being part of a team, my role centered on programming
                        the application as I already came from a programming background. Tasked with becoming more familiar with App Inventor, I relied on my prior knowledge of Java and C++ in order to better understand and become more familiar with MIT
                        App Inventor.</p>
