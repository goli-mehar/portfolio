                <!--Paragraph 1-->
                <p>Hello, my name is Mehar Goli. Currently, I am a rising senior at Dublin High School looking to start college next year. I plan to major in Computer Engineering as an undergraduate, while passing onto a concentration in Bioinformatics as
                    I study for my Master’s. I chose Bioinformatics as my career choice as it provides a cross between the subject areas I enjoy the most biology, medicine and computer science. I thus hope to pursue Bioinformatics through the medical
                    field.
                </p>
                <!--Paragraph 2-->
                <p>As an individual, I am not a natural born leader, but am very detail-oriented and am willing to take the lead in the group for a project to progress well. My sophomore year of high school, my final project for my Human Body Systems class
                    was to simulate a patient case of gastroenteritis, stomach flu. Needing to process and organize multiple documents, it was this detail-oriented nature of mine that allowed me to push my group to the finals during our Grand Rounds.
                    I am also very diligent, persevering under pressure to solve any problems I face. In my junior year of high school, I decided to build an automated toilet detector in order to stop the constant leaks my house faces. Only knowing Java
                    at the time, I taught myself the basics of C++ in order to successfully program the ESP8266 board I was using. While the process proved difficult, it was truly rewarding in the end, as I was able to enter the Alameda county Science
                    and Engineering Fair and win third place as well as a special prize from Ricoh, USA for targeting water conservation.
                </p>
                <!--Paragraph 3-->
                <p>Volunteering from junior year at Stanford Valleycare in the ER, I’ve come to understand the certain nature I possess. As an older sibling, I have learned how to care of others through my younger brother - however this has further translated
                    into a mother-like nature that has shown through my volunteering in the hospital. Meeting with different patients each day, I’ve also been able to come out of my introverted shell and become more sociable with strangers. This has translated
                    into further interactions with other content creators on Youtube. My sophomore year, I started a youtube channel looking at how different music groups would sing the songs of other artists. The channel served as a way to relieve stress
                    while also exploring a passion of mine - video editing. Through the channel I have been able to learn how to use Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects and Photoshop while picking up different techniques. While my passion developed, I was
                    still closed off from much of the community. The socialization skills I gained through my volunteering experience finally pushed me to take the plunge and become a part of the youtube community.</p>
                <!--Paragraph 4-->
                <p> Through all these different experiences, I’ve been able to become the individual I am today. I am ambitious and determined, yet I also have my own downfalls and weaknesses.
                </p>

                <p> Thank you for your time, I invite you to explore this site and continue to get to know me!</p>
