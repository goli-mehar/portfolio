                <p class="col-sm-8">I am currently a rising senior at Dublin High School, and am in the Biomedical Academy through which I have been taking medical based classes since my freshman year. Based on this, many would assume I am looking to pursue a career in medicine;
                    however, I acually want to enter Bioinformatics in the future. Healthcare has always been a dream of mine, from a young age I knew I wanted to be a part of the force that saves people from disease everyday. At first I thought I had
                    to go in as a doctor so I wavered a bit, knowing how nervous I could get in the moment when a patient is looking at me. From that point, I wasn't sure whether I would still go into healthcare - maybe it would be better if someone more
                    resilient was in this field. It wasn't until high school that I realized I could work in healthcare, with a background role - namely in Biomedical Engineering. Biomedical Engineering combines two passions of mine, healthcare and engineering
                    and is thus the career I wish to pursue. I plan to do this, as I have, by gaining experience with hospital work while also learning computor science languages in order to gain an engineering background. As a Biomedical Engineer, an
                    individual must be able to utilize a variety of perspectives to attack problems in a simple yet effective manner. Taking Biomedical Science classes in high school, my teachers have taught me to do this through the various projects
                    we have done. In sophomore year for example, the major project for the year was an imaginary patient case file erected based off of an assigned disease. This project forced me to look at Gastroenteritis in a medical manner, while also
                    finding a method to effectively portray the case file such that the public could understand the timeline of the patient case. I learned to adopt a medical lens, a lens that will be needed when entering biomedical engineering

                        <p>Toilet leaks can often be costly financially and environmentally due to the water wastage they incur, and while solvable there is yet to exist an efficient method to quickly notify an owner of any leaks. In the current system,
                            leaks often persist for months - often becoming apparent due to irregular increases in the water bill. Thus, the project intends to build a device such that it will quickly notify an owner of a toilet leak. A window sensor
                            and an arduino based interface are utilized to create the device, with a computer program to run the device and then utilize IFTTT to notify the homeowner of the leak. During experimentation, water sensors were found to be
                            more efficient and were thus incorporated, in addition, a speaker was added to notify the owner audibly. For further research, the device may be modified to work with pipes as well as be extended to work with multiple toilets
                            or even be connected to the home security system.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">January 2016 - June 2016</h3>
                        <p>In Human Body Systems, a class akin to Anatomy, the assignment was given to create an imaginary patient case file given a disease. All documentation including the process of the patient's initial visit up until their final visit.
                            Records of patient visits, and diagnoses were to be included. In this project, our final product was to be a google presentation which would be presented to the class, and - if we were selected - to present to a board of doctors.
                            Along with my partners, Donna Tran and Diane Pang, we chose Gastroenteritis - commonly known as stomach flu. In this case, I served as the Gastroenterologist, writing up order forms the required tests for the patient as well
                            as simulating the results the patient would have had over the course of the experiment. This project served as a lesson to me on how important communication is during collaborative projects. During this project we each were
                            kept on our toes to finish our parts while also notifying the others, however this wasn't the case at first. For the first few weeks of the project, we would work on our parts independently with little input from the others
                            - this proved futile as we were unable to get sufficient work done. After this mistake, we made sure to collaborate with each other and discuss each part of the project together, eventually being able to finish on time. This
                            correction proved beneficial as we then became finalists for the competition aspect, the Grand Rounds. </p>

                        <p> The objective of this project was to create an interactive storyline in which the player is able to build their own story. This was achieved through the use of Scratch and its ability to showcase different scenes, allowing for
                            the development of a storyline. WIthin this project, I served as the main programmer - learning and understanding how to use Scratch in order to build the game effectively. This role came as a result of group struggles in sharing
                            work, each of us had our own strengths and thus decided to take on different roles. Hence I handled programming while my partner dealt with documentation.</p>

                        <p>Colored Dots, a baseline mIT App Inventor application, consists of drawing with colored dots. While intereactive, the application is - overall - bland in taste. As such, the objective of this project was to revamp the application
                            and to make it more desirable to the average consumer. This project thus required becoming familiar with MIT App Inventor, and detailed accounts and block diagrams for the new app design. Being part of a team, my role centered
                            on building programming the application as I was more familiar with MIT App inventor</p>
